<h1>Querying Relationships Data</h1>
<p>There are 4 special tables that describe and index the wide variety of relationships that can be drawn, or are
automatically created, amongst all the Clients, Individual Contacts, Organisations and Matters on your system.</p>
<p>They are created automatically by the software whenever:</p>
<ul>
<li>you create a relationship between any pair of Individual Contacts, Organisations, Client or Matters</li>
<li>you add two or more Individual Contacts or Organisations to form a multi-party Client</li>
<li>you create a single party client</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>These 4 special tables are called:</p>
<ul>
<li>CONTRELATIONS</li>
<li>CLIERELATIONS</li>
<li>MATTRELATIONS</li>
<li>ORGARELATIONS</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>All four tables have the same number of fields holding the same kinds of information viz:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code of the &quot;relating&quot; contact, client or matter e.g. client code or contact reference number</li>
<li>The type of the related entity, e.g. "CL" for client, "MA" for matter</li>
<li>The code of the related entity, e.g. client code or matter code</li>
<li>A code describing in what capacity the related party is connected to the relating party (called the "role code")</li>
</ul>
<br />

<h2>Derivation of the Contact or Organisation reference number</h2>

<p>Each time you create a new Individual Contact or Organisation the software gives it a permanent and unique
reference which is simply a number that started at 1 and increases in steps of 1. Neither the number nor the method of incrementing the sequence can be
accessed or altered by you.</p>

<p>A Contact's or Organisation's reference number is always visible in the header of an Organisation or Contact
enquiry but you do not need to memorize or note it (except on a temporary basis if you want a report for one particular Contact or Organisation).</p>

<p>This treatment is in contrast to your Client and Matter codes which may well be tailored to your particular
house style and where you have some freedom to set or edit them yourself when creating new clients and their matters.</p>

<p>Remember that the unique reference is stored in two places in the main underlying Contact or Organisation record: 
once in numeric format in the field called REFERENCE and a second time as a string in the field called REFERENCE-CHAR.  (This provides greater
flexibility in looking up contact–related information in other data tables. For technical reasons the linking fields in the look up tables 
must in some cases be numeric themselves, and in other cases strings, and links can only be forged between fields of the same data type).</p>
<br />
<h2>How many RELATIONS table records there will be on the system</h2>

<p>Each and every record in any of the four RELATIONS tables &quot;belongs to&quot; an
underlying main record, identified by the value of its first field, and found
in either CLIDB, CONTACTS, MATDB or ORGANISATION.   Many RELATIONS records
could all belong to the same underlying main record. For example,  you could
relate one single contact to a large and potentially  unlimited number of
clients to represent someone who introduces new work.  This would produce one
CONTRELATIONS record and one CLIERELATIONS record for each client that the
contact introduces</p>

<p>Creating a Matter for a client <b>does not</b> create a MATTRELATIONS record. 
MATTRELATIONS records are only produced as a consequence of creating a
relationship between a Contact or Organisation and a Matter, from either the
Matter or Contact or Organisation Relationships tab</p>

<p>Individual Contact or Organisation records <b>do not have</b> corresponding CONTRELATIONS
or ORGARELATIONS records <b>until</b> you create a relationship involving them,
or create a single-party or multi-party client with them</p>

<p>Remember that when you create a single-party client the software automatically creates a
relationship between the client and its pre-existing CONTACTS or ORGANISATION
record. So, for every client on your system there will be <b>one</b>
CLIERELATION record <b>plus one</b> CONTRELATION or ORGARELATION record <b>for
each party to the client record including the first</b></p>


<p>Records in any of the RELATIONS tables will disappear from your system <b>immediately</b>
if you run the <b>Remove a Party or Organisation</b> option from a multi-party
client set/up screen, or if you choose the <b>Delete this Relationship</b>
routine from the Relationships tab of a Client or Contact/Organisation record
(Removing a party or deleting a relationship does not in any way delete or
affect the underlying CONTACTS or ORGANISATION record)</p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of different relationships that one entity might have
on your system.  Please also note that it is now possible to relate exactly the same two entities together with different roles,
so for example if Contact A is related to Contact B with a role code of "Husband" it is also possible to relate Contact A to
Contact B with a role code of "Executor".  This facility was first released in PM V4.16 0810 Patch 0 and Connect V2.8.1 (released August 2010).</p>
<br />
<h2>The Reciprocal Principle</h2>

<p>Each relation between parties has two perspectives, according to which party you are considering so <b>each and
every relationship will be represented by two separate records</b> to be found somewhere amongst these 4 relationship tables.</p>

<p>For example, suppose your system has a client record for John Smith (and his client code is SM0356), and a contact
record for his wife Ann Smith (Contact reference 14257), and you create a
&quot;database&quot; relationship between the two. You have already created in ROLES
maintenance the code WI (Wife) and the code HU (Husband). The system will
create two records, one in CLIERELATIONS and the other in CONTRELATIONS like
this:</p>
<br />
<p><b>CLIERELATIONS record for Mr John Smith</b></p>
<p></p><table>
<tr><td>CL-CODE</td><td>"SM0356"</td></tr>
<tr><td>REL-FILE</td><td>"CO"</td></tr>
<tr><td>REL-RECORD</td><td>"14257"</td></tr>
<tr><td>ROL-CODE</td><td>"WI" (Wife)</td></tr>
</table></p>
<br />
<p><b>CONTRELATIONS record for Mrs Ann Smith</b></p>
<p><table>
<tr><td>CON-REFERENCE</td><td>14257</td></tr>
<tr><td>REL-FILE</td><td>"CL"</td></tr>
<tr><td>REL-RECORD</td><td>"SM0356"</td></tr>
<tr><td>ROL-CODE</td><td>"HU" (Husband)</td></tr>
</table></p>
<br />
<p><b>Special values for Role Codes in CLIERELATIONS CONTRELATIONS and ORGARELATIONS</b></p>
<p>As an exception to the above, ROL-CODE does not take these user-selectable &quot;natural&quot; role codes when the
relationship between entities is that of individual contacts or organisations
constituting a &quot;joint client&quot; or, at its simplest, one sole individual contact
or organisation who is also a client.</p>

<p><b>For multi-party clients there will be:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>for each CONTRELATION/ORGARELATION (one for each party): ROL-CODE has the value
&quot;C*&quot; to signal that the related party referenced by REL-RECORD is a CLIENT to
whom the CONTACT/ORGANISATION has been added as a joint party</li>
<li>for each
CLIERELATION (one for each party): ROL-CODE has the value &quot;M*&quot;  to signal
that the related party referenced by REL-RECORD is in a multi-party client
relationship to the client whose code is in CL-CODE</li>
</ul>

<p><b>For a solo client there will be:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>a single CONTRELATIONS or ORGARELATIONS record pointing to the CLIDB record: ROL-CODE is "C*"</li>
<li>a single CLIERELATIONS record pointing to its underlying CONTACTS or ORGANISATION: ROL-CODE is "M*"</li>
</ul>

<p>In all other cases of relationships you have created that involve clients, or contacts or organisations, ROL-CODE
contains a &quot;natural&quot; relationship code that you have selected.</p>

<p>Note that <b>MATTRELATIONS is never affected</b> in any way by these exceptions, nor as a consequence of
relationships made by CLIENTS or CONTACTS or ORGANISATIONS, so its ROL-CODE
field always contains a &quot;natural&quot; role code that you have selected.</p>
<br />
<h2>COMMON FIELD NOTES</h2>

<p>All fields apart from the first in each of the four tables can conveniently be described together. In
CONTRELATIONS or ORGARELATIONS the first field will be the unique
software-generated reference number already described.  In CLIERELATIONS it
will be a Client code, and in MATTRELATIONS a full Client Matter code.</p>

<p><b>REL-FILE</b> is a two-letter abbreviation of the table containing the detail of the related party viz one from:</p>
<ul>
<li>"CL" - where the link is to a client</li>
<li>"CO" - where the link is to another contact</li>
<li>"MA" -where the link is to a matter (or an archive)</li>
<li>"OR" - where the link is to an organisation</li>
</ul>

<p><b>REL-RECORD</b> is the identifier of the related party and its style will depend on the REL-FILE value viz:</p>
<ul>
<li>If REL-FILE is "CL" then REL-RECORD will be a client code</li>
<li>If REL-FILE is "CO" or "OR" then REL-RECORD will be a number (contact or organisation reference)</li>
<li>If REL-FILE is "MA" then REL-RECORD will be a full client matter code </li>
</ul>

<p><b>ROL-CODE</b> describes in code form how the related party is related to
the contact. These codes and their description are set up by you in the<b>
ROLES</b> <b>maintenance </b>program, subject to the Special Values exceptions already noted.</p>
