<h2>PRACTICE MANAGER INTERFACE</h2>
<p>TRANALYSIS is, contents-wise, directly modelled on NOMACCS. But unlike NOMACCS which is �descended� from NOMCODES, the underlying �code� of
a TRANALYSIS record has been preset by our software, so it does not link to NOMCODES. Also, with the one important exception of code
PM09 (Profit Costs Paid), the preset analysis codes do not hold accounting data but instead hold Time Recording and other practice data.</p>
<p>You can see a list of TRANALYSIS codes within Practice Manager in any of the following places:</p>
<p><b>File -> Setup -> Balance Loading -> Analysis Budgets</b></p>
<p><b>File -> Setup -> Balance Loading -> Analysis Balances</b></p>
<p><b>Reports -> Business Reports -> Management Report: Drop down lists in the Code Selection control</b></p>
<p><b>Reports -> Business Reports -> Departmental Report: Drop down list in the Column Content panel</b></p>
<br>
<h2>Calculating Period End balances</h2>
<p>Just as with NOMACCS, note that the CLOSING-BAL and CLOSING-BUDG fields always contain cumulative actual or budget balances to date, but not to any
given historic period end. For example if it is now Period 7 there is no figure directly available in the table for a balance as at the end of Period 4. To report on
historic information you will therefore have to create formulae to calculate these intermediate cumulative balances.</p>
<p>For example to derive the end of Period 4 actual balance you can create a formula called, say, YTDPeriod4 consisting of the following expression:</p>
<p><b>TRANALYSIS.OPENING-BAL + TRANALYSIS.PERIOD-BAL@1 + TRANALYSIS.PERIOD-BAL@2 + TRANALYSIS.PERIOD-BAL@3 + TRANALYSIS.PERIOD-BAL@4</b></p>
<p>FEE-EARNER and MT-TYPE will <b>always</b> be used - unlike NOMACCS where you have control over whether or not postings are analysed by fee earner and matter type.</p>
<br>
<h2>First category of TRANALYSIS codes � preset by Practice Manager software</h2>
<p>From the lists visible in Practice Manager you should be able to see immediately that there are two types of TRANALYSIS code on your
system. The first type comprises codes wholly preset by SOS and they are compulsory. These all start with the prefix PM or TIME and
there are more than twenty of these altogether. Except for PM09 they are all Client/Matter Statistic and Time Management Analysis
codes. Every firm using Practice Manager automatically has data stored under these analysis headings whether or not it is wanted or
used. The complete list of this first category is as follows:</p>
<br>
<table>
<tr><td><b>PM01</b></td><td><b>Matters opened</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM02</b></td><td><b>Matters closed</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM03</b></td><td><b>New clients introduced</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM04</b></td><td><b>New clients sources</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM05</b></td><td><b>Legal aid matters opened</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM06</b></td><td><b>Charge band matters opened</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM07</b></td><td><b>New prospects sources</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM08</b></td><td><b>Not used</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM09</b></td><td><b>Costs paid</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM10</b></td><td><b>New clients estimated costs</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEA</b></td><td><b>Cost of Time recorded</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEB</b></td><td><b>Chargeable value of time recorded</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEC</b></td><td><b>Costs billed via time recording</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMED</b></td><td><b>WIP at cost of time</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEE</b></td><td><b>WIP at chargeable value of time</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEF</b></td><td><b>Profit based on cost of time</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEG</b></td><td><b>Profit based on chargeable value of time</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEH</b></td><td><b>Minutes of Chargeable �standard time �</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEI</b></td><td><b>Minutes of Chargeable �overtime�</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEJ</b></td><td><b>Minutes of Non-chargeable �standard time�</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEK</b></td><td><b>Minutes of Non-chargeable �overtime�</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEL</b></td><td><b>Cost of non-chargeable time recorded</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEM</b></td><td><b>Cost of time written off</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEN</b></td><td><b>Chargeable value of time written off</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEO</b></td><td><b>Profit based on cost of time for closed matters</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIMEP</b></td><td><b>Profit based on chargeable value of time for closed matters</b></td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<h2>Second category of TRANALYSIS codes - user defined</h2>
<p>The second category is derived from just those Time Recording Activity Codes where you have set the Analysis flag to Yes. It follows
that the number of these codes on your system can be anything from zero upwards, limited only by the number of activity codes you have
chosen to create and mark for Analysis.</p>
<p>The actual format of analysis codes in this category comprises the Activity code itself, followed by the same set of suffixes as the TIME
codes shown above, from A through to P. Note that 3 of the 16 TIME codes ie those with suffixes J K and L are exclusive to non-chargeable
time recording, so chargeable activity codes will have a maximum possible 13 analysis codes per fee earner/matter type. Non-chargeable
activity codes will have a maximum possible three analysis codes viz those suffixed J K or L.</p>
<p>For example suppose you have an activity code of PTEL for telephone calls on private client work, the effect of switching on its analysis flag
will be to create and populate no less than 5 new TRANALYSIS records as soon as the very first time posting of this activity is recorded viz:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>PTELA</b></td><td><b>Cost of time spent on the phone</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PTELB</b></td><td><b>Chargeable value of time spent on the phone</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PTELD</b></td><td><b>WIP at cost of time spent on the phone</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PTELE</b></td><td><b>WIP at chargeable value of time spent on the phone</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PTELH</b></td><td><b>Minutes if Chargeable �standard time� spent on the phone </b></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Other TRANALYSIS codes starting with PTEL will be automatically created by the software during the year if and when billing and closure and
write offs take place. Also remember that a new set of PTEL records is created for each new Fee earner and Matter Type combination that engages
in posting PTEL time entries, so everyone using the PTEL time posting activity code is going to generate a minimum of five more TRANALYSIS records!<p>
<p>Thus TRANALYSIS codes starting with TIME give you a picture of time and WIP per fee earner/matter type but without reference to any particular
activity, while TRANALYSIS codes starting with your own Time Activity codes give the same fee earner/ matter type breakdown but by reference to activities.</p>
<p>There are a possible maximum 13 heads of TIME analysis for chargeable work, so any one of your time activity codes could spawn no less
than 13 TRANALYSIS records for each fee earner/matter type combination engaged in that activity. A fresh set of TRANALYSIS records is then generated
by the software for each new financial year of your system�s operation. You will by now have realised this could quickly generate an enormous number
of TRANALYSIS records, so we recommend you don�t flag individual activity codes for Analysis without careful thought. Users are more likely to switch
analysis on for Non chargeable and leave it off for Chargeable activities but this isn�t a fixed rule and your firm may have reasons to deviate from it.</p>
<p>Note in this context that future amendments to the Activity record have no retrospective effect, so switching on the Activity�s analysis flag won�t
generate TRANALYSIS data for previous time entries for that activity. Similarly, switching off the Activity�s analysis flag won�t destroy existing TRANALYSIS
records for that activity.</p>
<br>
<h2>TYPE field usage note</h2>
<p>Note that in some cases the whole analysis �code� as seen from Practice Manager is held in the CODE field but in other cases the �code� is split between
the CODE field and the TYPE field. Here are the rules governing which of the two fields are used in different cases:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>PM01 PM02 PM03</b></td><td>Whole analysis code is in the CODE field. TYPE field is always blank</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM05</b></td><td>TYPE field will hold the Legal Aid Status as defined in LASTATUS.LA-STATUS</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>PM06</b></td><td>TYPE field will hold the Chargeband code as defined in CHARGEBANDS.BAND</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Other PM codes</b></td><td>Whole analysis code is in the CODE field. TYPE field is always blank</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>TIME plus a letter</b></td><td>Only the word TIME is in the CODE field. TYPE field holds remaining letter</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Activity code plus a letter</b></td><td>Only the activity code is in the CODE field. TYPE field holds remaining letter</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<h2>Other Field Notes</h2>
<p>With the exception of the opening and individual period budget balance fields all the numeric values are updated as a by-product of time recording
or client matter creation/closure or recording profit costs received, and are not normally directly accessible or editable. The other fields are
created and preset by the software.Budget/targets can be set or adjusted with the following sequence:</p>
<br>
<b>File -> Setup -> Balance Loading -> Analysis Budgets</b>
<br>
<h2>Optional formatting and conversion of different kinds of data</h2>
<p>All budget and period figures are numbers but they represent a range of sometimes incompatible information viz:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>Integer numbers</b></td><td><b>PM01 to PM07</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Integer money values</b></td><td><b>PM10</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Decimal money values</b></td><td><b>PM09</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>TIME A to TIME G</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>TIME L to TIME P</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>All Time Activity codes suffixed A to G and L to P</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<b>Integer time in minutes</b></td><td><b>TIME H to TIME K</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><b>All Time Activity codes suffixed H to K</b></td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>Be careful not to create data columns or formulae which purport to add or subtract these wholly different kinds of number to or from one another!</p>
<p>When reporting on codes that are integer numbers eg a report showing the number of new matters opened, take advantage of Crystal�s field
formatting ie right click on these fields and then format them so that they will show simply as integers rather than with an annoying and repetitive .00 after each figure.</p>
<p>When reporting on codes that are integer time in minutes you can convert them for presentation purposes to hours and minutes using a formula, as in the following examples:</p>
<br>
<p><b>This one shows details for period 3:</b></p>
<p>ToText(Truncate({TRANALYSIS.PERIOD-BAL@3}/60),"####0")+ " hrs "
<br>+
<br>ToText(Remainder({TRANALYSIS.PERIOD-BAL@3},60),"00")+ " mins"
</p>
<br>
<p><b>This one gives you Fee Earner totals for period 3 to place in a Fee Earner group header or footer:</b></p>
<br>ToText(Truncate(Sum({TRANALYSIS.PERIOD-BAL@3},{TRANALYSIS.FEE-EARNER})/60),"####0")+ " hrs "
<br>+
<br>ToText(Remainder(Sum({TRANALYSIS.PERIOD-BAL@3},{TRANALYSIS.FEE-EARNER}),60),"00")+ " mins"
<p>
</p>
<br>
<h2>LINKING AND APPLICATION</h2>
<p>TRANALYSIS will be useful in a wide variety of management reports for summarising time recording, costs paid or practice statistical
data. Each TRANALYSIS record is essentially self-contained - it holds its own text description � this contrasts with NOMACCS where you need
NOMCODES to provide the account description. But it is not possible to �drill down� from TRANALYSIS into tables such as TRTRANS or NOMTRANS
or CLIDB or MATDB. In other words it is not possible to verify the figures in TRANALYSIS against any of these tables by direct linkage. However, most
time related totals can be derived independently of TRANALYSIS by reading and totalling selected detail held in TRTRANS, while the PM codes (apart
from PM09) can ultimately be checked against opening and closing dates in tables like CLIDB and MATDB.</p>
<p>Also it is not possible from TRANALYSIS for you to simply drill down into the totals presented for Costs Paid in analysis code PM09 to establish
the detail such as payment dates, individual client matter codes, bills delivered values and cash receipts per matter. However these can
with difficulty be derived via the NOMTRANS and PAYMENTS tables - but unfortunately this can be complicated, and if at all possible it is much
easier if you can simply rely on the summary Fee Earner and Matter Type period totals held in PM09 instead.</p>
<p>Although TRANALYSIS cannot be linked effectively to important transaction detail or database master tables like NOMTRANS, TRTRANS, CLIDB
or MATDB it is OK to use its FEE-EARNER and MT-TYPE fields for linking up in the usual way with the FEETR, DEPARTMENT and MATTYPE tables respectively
to provide full fee earner names, department names and matter type descriptions for grouping and presentational purposes. </p>
