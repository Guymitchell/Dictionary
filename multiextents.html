<h2>Extracting data from multiple-extent fields</h2>
<p>Certain database fields are defined as "multiple-extent" fields.  This means that the field can hold multiple values of the 
same data type.  A common example of this is where a field holds a set of financial balance values, one for each period from 1 to 13.</p>
<p>Database views have been created for many of the more commonly used tables containing multiple-extent fields, with each entry of 
a multiple-extent field separated out into its own column.  These have been created to make it easier to choose specific extents 
from a multiple-extent field when building queries and reports.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Data table:</td><td>PUB.MATANALYSIS</td></tr>
<tr><td>Field name:</td><td>BAL-UPB</td></tr>
<tr><td>No. Extents:</td><td>13</td></tr>
<tr><td>Purpose:</td><td>Each row is for a specific matter and year: this field holds the unpaid bills balance for the matter by period (1-13).</td></tr>
</table>
<br />
<br />
<table>
<tr><td>Data view:</td><td>A.MATANALYSIS</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>Field names:</td><td>BAL-UPB@1 (unpaid bills balance for period 1)<br />
BAL-UPB@2 (unpaid bills balance for period 2)<br />
BAL-UPB@... etc.<br />
BAL-UPB@13 (unpaid bills balance for period 13)<br /></td></tr>
</table>
<br />
<p>However you are not restricted to using the database views in order to access the separate values of a multiple-extent field.  The 
following SQL query syntax will extract the unpaid bills balances in year 2011 for periods 1 – 3 in separate columns*:</p>
<code>Select "cl-code", "mt-code", "bal-upb"[1], "bal-upb"[2], "bal-upb"[3] from pub.matanalysis where "year" = '2010'</code>
<p>Note that the referencing of extent numbers is done in square brackets [ ] after the field name, starts from 1 and can rise to 
the maximum extent number as shown in the data dictionary.  Referencing an extent number out of this range will produce the following Progress ODBC driver error message:</p>
<code>Invalid array element reference (12663)</code>
<p>This method of referring to specific array elements returns data in the specified field format, which means that mathematical operations 
can be performed directly on the values returned.  For example this query adds the unpaid bills balances for periods 1,2 and 3 together 
and returns the result in a column called SUMQ1:</p>
<code>Select "cl-code", "mt-code", "bal-upb"[1] + "bal-upb"[2] + "bal-upb"[3] as SumQ1 from pub.matanalysis</code>
<p>You should find that this method of extracting individual values from multiple-extent fields is quicker than using the 
data view (if there is one).  This is because the data view splits out all multiple-extent values on all fields when the view is accessed, whereas 
in practice you may only be extracting a small number of extents from a small number of fields.</p>
